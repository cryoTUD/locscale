## LocScale â€“ reference-based density scaling for local sharpening of cryo-EM maps
---

Locscale is a density scaling (sharpening) procedure that aims to enhance interpretability of cryo-EM density maps  
  
LocScale has been initiated at EMBL and is now developed at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft.  

Please note that there is a GUI implemented version available as part of the [CCP-EM](http://www.ccpem.ac.uk/) project.
